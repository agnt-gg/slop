### Dice Rolls
- **D20 System**: Most actions are determined by a 20-sided die roll
- **Outcome Tiers**:
  - 1: Critical Failure (something terrible happens)
  - 2-5: Very Bad Outcome
  - 6-10: Poor Outcome
  - 11-15: Moderate Success
  - 16-19: Great Success
  - 20: Critical Success (extraordinary results)

### Character Stats
- Track health, mana, strength, dexterity, and more
- Stats influence your ability to succeed at different types of challenges

### Inventory System
- Collect weapons, armor, potions, and quest items
- Equipment affects your character's capabilities in combat and exploration

## 🏗️ Technical Architecture

AI Quest is built using the SLOP protocol, which provides a simple, standardized way for AI applications to communicate.

### Backend (Server)
- **Express.js** server implementing SLOP endpoints
- **OpenAI API** integration for the AI Dungeon Master
- In-memory game state management (could be extended to use a database)

### Frontend (Client)
- Simple HTML/CSS/JavaScript client
- Real-time interface updates with dice animations
- Character sheet and inventory management

### SLOP Endpoints Used
- `/chat` - Main interaction with the AI Dungeon Master
- `/tools` - Game mechanics like combat resolution
- `/memory` - Saving and loading game state
- `/resources` - Game assets and information

## 🛠️ Customization

Want to create your own adventure or modify the game? Here are some things you can customize:

- **System Prompt**: Edit the AI instructions in `server.js` to change the game style
- **UI Theme**: Modify the CSS in `index.html` to create your own look and feel
- **Game Mechanics**: Adjust dice rolls, stats, and items to balance gameplay

## 📚 SLOP Protocol

This project implements the [SLOP protocol](https://github.com/agentprotocol/SLOP) (Simple Language Open Protocol) - a standardized way for AI services to communicate through simple HTTP endpoints. 

SLOP makes AI integration as easy as:
- Regular HTTP requests with JSON data
- Standardized endpoints for different AI capabilities
- No complex libraries or frameworks required
